Cellular Phones
This is a collectible. There is no way to get service.
Call or email me.

This is one of the earliest cell phones. This kind of phone
Was often used by Zack Morris from saved by the bell. It 
may not work for communication but it still has great 
historical value as the forefather of modern cell phones.
